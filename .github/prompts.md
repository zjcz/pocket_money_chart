Create a react web app to show a monthly calendar view to track my childs pocket money.  Use the attached image as a reference, which shows the chart for February 2025.  Each day contains the tasks my child needs to complete to obtain their pocket money for that day.

The calendar doesn't look quite right.  Currently the days are listed vertically but should be horizontally.  The days are listed vertically next to it, but again they should be laid out as defined in the #file:pocket money.jpg sample

Reduce the height of the cells containing the days of the week to match the #file:pocket money.jpg sample
