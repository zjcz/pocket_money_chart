# 💰 Pocket Money Chart

This is a react web app I created to easily generate a monthly pocket money chart we print out for our child (yes, I know printing isn't very 2025 but it's just easier right now 🙄). 

Originally this was a document I managed in Google Docs, but I got tired of having to generate it each month. The majority of the code was generated using [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) with manual corrections where necessary. Prompts are recorded in [prompts.md](https://github.com/zjcz/pocket_money_chart/blob/main/docs/prompts.md) for reference.

## 💭 Thoughts
This project is something I have been planning to put together for a few months now and decided to use 'vibe coding' to see how far I could get without having to write any code.

I was pleasantly surprised with the results and the code is pretty clean. I did have to make a few changes to the generated code, but overall it was a great experience.  However, I feel there were a few areas where the generated code could be improved. For example, the generated code for the calendar component is a bit messy and could be simplified by splitting into smaller components. I also had to manually add some CSS styles to make the calendar look better.  Perhaps my prompting could have been better to make it clear exactly what I wanted.
