# 💰 Pocket Money Chart

This is a react web app I created to easily generate a monthly pocket money chart we print out for our child (yes, I know printing isn't very 2025 but it's just easier right now 🙄). 

Originally this was a document I managed in Google Docs, but I got tired of having to generate it each month. The majority of the code was generated using [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) with manual corrections where nessasery. Promps are recorded in [prompts.md](https://github.com/zjcz/pocket_money_chart/blob/main/docs/prompts.md) for reference.
